<h1>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h1>
<p><b>PFD.</b><br>
<a href="http://madebypfd.com/">madebypfd.com </a></p>
<p><b>Focus Lab</b><br>
<a href=" http://focuslabllc.com/">focuslabllc.com </a></p>

<h1>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h1>
	<p><b>PFD</b><br>
		The visual hierarchy of the website is clear and simple. The focal point begins at the bold logo then leads directly down to either the copy and to the colorful grid based content blocks. <br></p>
		<p>The navigation menu is hidden behind the hamburger-style button on the right, which lets the users focus more on the content on the homepage. The downside is that the icon is not noticeable so the users may not easily find the navigation menu when they need it.</p>
<p><b>Focus Lab</b><br>
	The flow of the website is well balanced. The large negative space draws the user&#39;s eyes to the largest focal point on the left then to the logo above it. Next, they move their way back to the subtle &quot;play&quot; button floating in the middle of the negative space enticing the users to click it. The subtle video of their company culture playing in the red background creates distinction from the other design studios.<br></p>
	<p>The pages below the homepage are in the following sections:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>What they produce.</li>
	<li>Who they are.</li>
	<li>Link to their portfolio.</li> 
	<li>Their blog or case studies.</li> 
	</ol>
	<p> To help the users to get through all the content of the website, the use of typographic hierarchy in each section leads the users to the CTA, which is accented in their company color.<br></p>
	<p>The con to the web design layout is there was no clear indication of more content below the homepage. The users may be less compelled to scroll down. <br></p>
	<p>Due to a web surfers natural tendency to scroll down, this may not be an issue for majority of the users.</p> 

<h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>
<p>Similarities:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Grid systems are used in order to bring visual structure and balance to the design.</li>
	<li>Both layouts utilize the negative space so the user&#39;s eyes are drawn to the focal point.</li>
	<li>Grid based content blocks are used to display their portfolio pieces, which makes the presentation look clean and attractive.</li></ul>

<p>Difference:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>The visual flow of PFD is smoother than Focus Lab because there is less content on the homepage.</li></ul>

<h1>Thumnail Sketches</h1>
<h2>My Portfolio</h2>
<p>Similar to PFD and Focus Lab, the negative space will lead the user&#39;s eyes to the logo then to the content below. Both thumbnails will have colorful grid based content blocks which will feature my portfolio pieces. As the users scroll down, the hierarchy will be on the portfolio, the copy will be secondary.</p>
<p>The logo will shrink so it fits inside the navigation bar, which will lock into place so it does not disappear when the user scrolls down. The dotted red line is to show what is above the fold. </p>

	The white negative space after the two portfolio blocks separates the bottom content of other projects that the users may be interested in viewing afterwards.</ul>
