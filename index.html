<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I lead an in-house print design team in a marketing department for a software company. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I want to better understand web and know how to build one. I would also like to be able to deliver constructive criticism to my web designer and to my inbound marketing team.</p>
<h2>My Mission</h2>
